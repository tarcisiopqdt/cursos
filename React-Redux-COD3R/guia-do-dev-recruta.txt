How to do it with just the command line
1 >>>>>>  Create a new repository on GitHub and initialize it with a README file

2 >>>>>>  Create a folder on your local machine

3 >>>>>>  Open terminal and move to that folder

$ cd FOLDER
4 >>>>>>  Add the remote URL as origin
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git


5 >>>>>> Now using the pull command, you can ‘pull’ down the README file onto the local folder
//Sincronizar com repositório remoto
